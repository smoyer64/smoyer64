== Born to build

For as long as I can remember, I've been building - with wooden blocks
as a toddler, Legos in elementary school (and perhaps a bit longer) and
in wood, metal and plastic as my training progressed and my skills
improved.  In high-school, I discovered electronics and quickly grew to
love embedded systems.  And making a career out of what you love is an
awesome way to earn a living.

Two-thousand years ago, Vitruvius penned the quote shown above -
throughout my practice as an engineer, I've come to realize that well 
designed and implemented systems often have these three attributes.  I've
also learned that maintainability is an equally important facet of a
product.  Today's embedded systems, such as a consumer grade router, can
be upgraded but how many customers actually do?

Lately I've focused on producing software products that share these four
traits.  It's estimated that the cost of creating a software product
accounts for only 20% of the total cost over its lifetime.  If
maintenance accounts for the other 80%, creating maintainable software
can have a huge ROI.  The SOLID principles, Clean Code principles, DRY,
and YAGNI - applied pragmatically instead of becoming a zealous dogma -
help guide our system design to achieve these four architectural
principles.

I've got a wide range of interests and experience that's waiting to be
put to use - what can I build for you?
